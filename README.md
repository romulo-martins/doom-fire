# Doom Fire

My implementarion of the Doom fire Algorithm, based on 
[Filipe Deschamps tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxm8cadCqbs). The original was written with vanilla javascript, so i tried to write with ruby programming language using the gosu library and adding movement and intensity features.
